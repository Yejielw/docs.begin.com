## Overview

FaunaDB is a globally-distributed, serverless, cloud database service for modern applications. It enables you to instantly create a full-featured data backend for applications, in seconds. The main takeaway of this doc is how well FaunaDB works with serverless applications.

## Getting started

### Sign up for a FaunaDB account

The first thing you want to do is [create an account with FaunaDB](https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register) so that you can: 

- create databases
- create data within those databases
- and then query that data

After you have created your account, you will need to configure your development environment for FaunaDB. Follow and complete the official FaunaDB [Quick start guide](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/start/cloud) before progressing on to the next section of this documentation.

> FaunaDB is free to use, up to a generous quantity of read or write operations, data transfer, and storage. If you exceed the free limits, pricing is very reasonable. [See our the FaunaDB Pricing page for details.](https://fauna.com/pricing)
